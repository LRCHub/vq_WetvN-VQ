Watching the moon sail out of the east
Plowing the waves of the sky
Blackbirds alone give voice to the night
As I'm standing silently by
Hardly a cloud, barely a breeze
Softly the meadows do sigh
Oh, would you stay, moment of peace
If but just now I could die?

If I could tie myself in time
Stay moment, you're so sweet
Why must I down from where I've climbed?
Stay moment, you're so sweet
Sweeter than a flower's blossom
Resting in the evening's bosom

Beautifully drunk, happy and calm
Lie on my back in the grass
Fancy and whim, brilliant plans
Idly I let them all pass
Inside, outside, all are in tune
Chiming harmoniously
If I can't halt the passage of time
At least let it move languidly

If I could tie myself in time
Stay moment, you're so sweet
Why must I down from where I've climbed?
Stay moment, you're so sweet
Sweeter than a flower's blossom
Resting in the evening's bosom

Stay, moment!

Verweile doch, du bist so schön!
