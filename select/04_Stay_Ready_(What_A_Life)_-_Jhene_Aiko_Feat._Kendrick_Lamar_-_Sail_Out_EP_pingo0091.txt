We do not exist in
Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here, I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreamin' times two
I promise you

If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You'll probably be with it forever
So how does it sound, us on the ground
Giving you my love?

(Oh, yeah)
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

You tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on my like you're Pac, got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some 90s shit, wrap your leggings around my hip

I'm so hip to it, tourists wanna come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And yeah, it's obvious mom'nem probably can't stand me
I'm sure they tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (mmm), we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record, and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection

I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats that's inside this Porsche

Come to me
Come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only 'cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours

(Oh, yeah)
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
Like, right now
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
Like, right now

I been through some shit man
But I be on my shit man
I decided that what you give is what you're given
So I been tryna do it right
I been doing like
Whatever gets me through the night

What a life
I'm steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losing all control

What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life

They say the truth ain't pretty
But coming from that pretty mouth the truth is fitting
'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud and you know plenty
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout 'cause you just get me
Yeah, you so pretty

If everything is dipped in gold
Then, baby, it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar-coated

What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life that I've been given
What a life
What a life that I been living
What a life
What a life we die to live in
What a life

What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
